Just as webpages grew bloated with ads, so too have ad blockers grown bloated with little-used
filtering rules and features that sap their speed and hog your computer or device’s CPU, memory, and
storage. Adblock Fast executes a mere 12 optimized filtering rules to accelerate pages 8x more but
consume 6x less computing resources than other ad blockers do.

the status of the site and page you’re on:

![Blocked ads](opera/chrome/images/blocked-ads.png) Ads are being blocked on the
site and ads were found on the page.

![Blocked](opera/chrome/images/blocked.png) Ads are being blocked on the site,
but no ads were found on the page.

![Unblocked ads](opera/chrome/images/unblocked-ads.png) Ads aren’t being blocked
on the site, but ads were found on the page.

![Unblocked](opera/chrome/images/unblocked.png) Ads aren’t being blocked on the
site and no ads were found on the page.

If Adblock Fast is interfering with the behavior of the page, you can click the
button to unblock ads. Your choice will be remembered whenever you return to the
site.
