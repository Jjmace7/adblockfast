**Summary:**

The world’s fastest ad blocker! Same blocking, 8x more accelerated page loading.

**Description:**

Ad Block Fast is a faster, open-source ad blocker.

Just as webpages grew bloated with ads, so too have ad blockers grown bloated with little-used
filtering rules and features that sap their speed and hog your computer’s CPU, memory, and storage.
Ad Block Fast runs a mere 12 optimized filtering rules to accelerate pages 8x more but consume 6x
less computing resources than other ad blockers do.

See Ad Block Fast’s site for source code, benchmarks, support, and frequently asked questions.

**Changelog:**

Routine five-year update.
