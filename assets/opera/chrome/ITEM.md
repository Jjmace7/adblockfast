# Adblock Fast

## Product details

**Description:**

Adblock Fast is a faster, open-source ad blocker.

Just as webpages grew bloated with ads, so too have ad blockers grown bloated with little-used
filtering rules and features that sap their speed and hog your computer’s disk space, CPU cycles,
and memory. Adblock Fast runs a mere 7 optimized filtering rules to accelerate pages 8x more but
consume 6x less system resources than other ad blockers do.
