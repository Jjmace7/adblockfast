<h1>Things are about to get a lot faster<em>!</em></h1>
<h2>
  Ad Block Fast is so fast that even reading the manual takes no time flat. Here’s everything you
  need to know.
</h2>
<p>
  A button was just installed in your browser’s toolbar. The button will indicate the status of each
  site and page you go to from now on:
</p>
<ul>
  <li id="blocked-ads">Ads are being blocked on the site and ads were found on the page.</li>
  <li id="blocked">Ads are being blocked on the site, but no ads were found on the page.</li>
  <li id="unblocked-ads">Ads aren’t being blocked on the site, but ads were found on the page.</li>
  <li id="unblocked">Ads aren’t being blocked on the site and no ads were found on the page.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If Ad Block Fast interferes with the behavior of the page, you can click the button to unblock
  ads. Your choice will be remembered whenever you’re on the site again.
</p>
